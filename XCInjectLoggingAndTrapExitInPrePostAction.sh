#  This script is a workaround for two problems with pre- and post- Xcode actions:
#  1. Exit status of the action is not respected, build proceeds even if action fails
#  2. Action log is lost
#
#  When pre-post-action fails for Xcode build, the build will be stopped, and have a chance to take a look at the action log.
#
#  Usage: source this script at the beginning of pre- or post-action, passing it a user-friendly *unique* pre- or post-action name, like below:
#
#      . "${SRCROOT:?}"/XCInjectLoggingAndTrapExitInPrePostAction.sh "preTest"
