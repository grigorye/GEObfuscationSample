			// This fails for short secrets. Probably due to NSTaggedPointerStrings or something. Couldn't figure it out yet.
			// Probably it's not that important as it *doesn't* fail for long secrets. Hence there's a chance that short secrets handled the same way as the long ones, with exclusion of the backing storage. And if obfuscation works for long secrets, it should work for short ones as well.
			// Anyway it might make sense to investigate it further/force short secrets stored exactly the same way as the long ones.
			// Btw, it's false positive, so it really doesn't mean that implementation indeed has a problem. It just indicates that we lack information about the real-time behaviour. We need it *here* just as a way to prove that obfuscated version indeed disappeared from memory after we purge it (see the next step ("Purge Secret").
